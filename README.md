Sixth semester diploma project, made alongside 2 classmates

This was a project we decided to pursue after we were asked to make a website to cater to the needs of a gift shop, who wanted a way to showcase their products with ease.
There are two portals, one for the various customers and one for the admins.
Customers can login and view all the available products, add products to their cart, and send their orders to their shop once they are done selecting what they want.

The admin portal is used to add new products and view the products' stock.
